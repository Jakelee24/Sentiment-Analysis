# Sentiment-Analysis
### Introduction
Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.

In this project I create the machine learning model which can classify positive and negative result of the sentence by using word2vec and LSTM. enjoy it ðŸ™‚

### Setup
**Make sure you have the following is installed:**
- Python3
- Tensorflow
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Dataset
for the dataset please make sure your training data .txt file is like following:

| Sentence  | Class  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  I like this movie! | 1  |
| I hate this feeling.  |  0 |

Once you prepared the training data, you can simply by execute the **example.py** to run the whole pipline.
```shell
python example.py
```
Or If you want to run the pipline step by step, please make sure you prepared the needed dataset for each module, Please check the Pipline chart to find it out. 

```shell
python word2vec_module.py
python DataProcess_module.py
python LSTM_module.py
```
